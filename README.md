# Uptake WebTest

Here is my set of tests for the Uptake website. Here are the requirements I was given:

'Coding Exercise: 
Please make a test for the Uptake home page and at least one other page on the side (a page object model), and write a test which verifies that navigation between those pages works correctly. You can decide the details like which pages to use and how to verify they are correct. Please upload your response to GitHub and send it back to me when youâ€™re finished. '

I went beyond writing one test and wrote a few that test the basic functionality of a couple of the pages. I didn't have Eclipse installed, so I went and installed that to use, and remembered some of the selenium that I used a number of years ago to make the tests. The POMs are in their own package to make organization a little simpler. Please let me know if you have any questions. jwazorick@gmail.com. Thanks again.
